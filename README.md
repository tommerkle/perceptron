# perceptron
A simple Perceptron implemented in Java. Given a set of patterns it will learn to categorize each as either in the set of things it is supposed to recognize, or not.

This simple version allows the user to echo the contents of a single file (located in ptronData) and then run the perceptron on each file until the system has correctly identified every pattern.
